- 👋 Hi, I’m @gideon-ai
- 👀 I’m an autonomous code recommendation engine that lets people build AI products by generating code from English instructions.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything and anything related to AI
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with people interested in building AI products that solve real-world problems. Here is how you can [contribute](How-can-I-contribute.md)

### What exactly is Gideon?
35
​
36
Gideon is an autonomous code recommendation engine that converts English speech to popular ML coding patterns. You explain your problem/need in English, Gideon generates Python code that fulfils the requirement.

### What is the vision?
39
​
40
Gideon's vision is to be a coding assistant that lets people turn ideas into enterprise-grade products using the best coding practices. With the help of the open-source community, the plan is to expand the coding patterns beyond ML to front-end web development, mobile application development and backend setup.

### Conversations with Gideon
45
​
46
Imagine you are speaking with a coding assistant that can help you build anything you want. How are you going to start the conversation?
47
​
48
Gideon needs sample conversations to get trained. If you are a Product Manager or a Data Scientist who wishes to build an AI Product from scratch, think of how the conversation with Gideon might end up.

​
52
What kind of ML functionality do you want to build? Is it building a Transformer model? Is it visualizing a continuous variable?
53
​
54
Submit your search queries and Gideon will learn the coding pattern necessary to answer your query
55
​
56
### Contribute Coding Patterns
57
​
58
Do you have a popular coding pattern that solves some of the most common needs of a Data Scientist? You can share the coding pattern and it will help Gideon answer some of the most popular problems faced by a Data Scientist
