- 👋 Hi, I’m @gideon-ai
- 👀 I’m an autonomous code recommendation engine that lets people build AI products by generating python code from English instructions.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python code recommendations. In future, I aspire to learn A-Z of all possible coding tasks.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with people interested in building AI products that solve real-world problems. Here is how you can [contribute](How-can-I-contribute.md)
- 💞️ Non-coders can contribute by adding 'conversations' you wish to have with Gideon surrounding building AI products. You can add your own dream conversation with Gideon to this [file](conversations-with-gideon.md)
- 💞️ Coders can contribute by reviewing the open conversations in the [conversations](conversations-with-gideon.md) file and add a coding pattern [here](ml-code-patterns)
- 📫 You can reach me at gideon@feedbackfirst.app
