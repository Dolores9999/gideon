#Warning: You should use this method only if the dataset is following a normal distribution across multiple columns
import pandas as pd
#Step1: Use Z-score function defined in scipy library to calculate the Z-scores for all the samples
z = np.abs(stats.zscore(df))
print(z)

##Step2: Remove the outliers using the z-score
df_z = df[(z < 2).all(axis=1)] #Z-score 2 is chosen here because we want to remove values which are in the top 5% of values. 

print("The no. of rows before outlier filtering was: ", df.shape)
print("The no. of rows after outlier filtering is: ", df_z.shape)
